## Inspiration

At times, I have felt out of ideas and desperate to meet the deadlines imposed by my teachers in my music class. I created this app to cater to those who are not very creative at writing songs like myself


## What it does

It creates new songs from the lyrics of the songs provided to it using Markov Chains.


## How we built it

This project was built using Python, and used PySimpleGUI, natural language toolkit, and NumPy .


## Challenges we ran into

Finding a framework to create the GUI was the main issue


## Accomplishments that we're proud of

Creating a program that outputs good lyrics.


## What we learned

Machine learning can be intimidating at times, but if you break it down into simple steps, it is much easier to understand.


## What's next for Lyricify

Create a sentiment analyzer using Naives Bayes Classifier to classify if a song's lyrics is positive or not.
